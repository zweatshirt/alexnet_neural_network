# AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network
- Jupyter notebook(s)
- PyTorch
- Implements  MNIST database.
- Pooling techniques and ReLU.

Trying to run this on a local machine probably wouldn't be a good idea.
CloudLab, a cloud computing service, is where I have been testing this code.

## Programs:
- Program 1 contains 12 3-dim layers which are all flattened at the end.
- Program 2 contains 9 3-dim layers, and the last 3 are fully connected linear layers.
- As it stands, the accuracy is not super high due to only using 1 epoch and other factors.

The MNIST data contains thousands of 224x224x1 images of digits ranging 0-9.
The AlexNet CNN trains on the data and learns to differentiate what number is in the image.



This is for learning how CNNs work.
